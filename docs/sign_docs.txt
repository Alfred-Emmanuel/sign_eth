Sign FunFact 3
Sign's community, the Orange Dynasty, is a very lovely community. Orange Community: https://x.com/ethsign

Our story is actually pretty cool.

Once upon a time, an intern at Sign (me!!!) decided to acquire the handle @sign and started posting silly memes and vibey content.
My vision at the time was to create a safe space for people to bring some fun back onto the timeline and create a real community with real humans.

I was Seeing Signs of great success in our future, and Sign's CM (community mod aka cutest mod) made the first pair of SignGlasses and changed the course of history.

As the Sign intern, I used the @sign account to vibe and chat with everyone who was seeing the Signs, regardless of their project affiliation, follower count, or any traditional 
project marketing metrics – I was a real human, and in turn made some of the most amazing real friends.

This vibe started catching on, and it turns out that people indeed feel and recipricate the love! Notifications started blowing up, people tapped into their creativity and 
craft, and we ended up on the X trending page twice! Then the fun part started: 
I started hopping onto twitter spaces and doubled down on fueling the community account 
with vibes (shoutout Sign daddy @realyanxin for being the only CEO in the world who lets 
their intern get this silly with the company verified twitter account) and started spilling
 4 years worth of alphas of everything Sign has built.

In less than 5 months, Sign's meme account turned into a home for over 27,000 (real!!!) people, with a lovely culture of mutual support, creativity, personal growth, and laughter.

100% organic, 0% bots, 100% human.
Please forget about everything you've learned about the culture of web3 communities as you read this with a fresh perspective:

Problem with Current Farming
Projects abuse users' platforms, small accounts are overlooked, big accounts get all the blame, people
 only come together to shill but don't make real connections, everything ends at TGE.

Sign's Approach
We want you to build your platform, we treat all accounts equally, we want you to imagine 
what you want to do with your platform, strive towards your creative goal, and we support and boost your platform. 
we will also connect you with like-minded people and potential collaborators.

Problem with Community-project Distrust
It's sad that there's a norm that projects lie to community members.
